# ExpressVPN-Update

As of now, ExpressVPN doesn't have a way to automatically check for updates and install the newest version, so I wrote a handy little script to manage that.
Please note: I have very little knowledge and skill in the way of scripting, so there are likely some less than preferred practices in here.
